# What's next?

More data! Or less?

- v4 sequencing dictated by Illumina technology, not superiority of v4 alone
- Single variable region often only gives genus level resolution
- Full 16S usually gives species, sometimes subspecies

Illumina vs Nanopore

![Long Reads](Nanopore-sequencing.jpg){width=80%}

- ** Tens of thousands of short reads < Fewer long reads **
- *** As long as the quality of the long reads is g'nuff ***


----

#Nanopore

- R10
    - Should be g'nuff quality but q scores wildly inflated
    - CO1 (bettles and mites) g'nuff
    - 16S not g'nuff
    - trying UMI initial cluster to polish reads
