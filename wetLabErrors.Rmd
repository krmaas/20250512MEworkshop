# Wet lab potential errors or failures

- Sample switching
- Contamination
- Failed extraction
- Failed PCR
- Mis-pooled

---

# Wet lab-potential errors 

- Scary, potentially silent errors
    - Sample switching
    - Mislabeled initially
    - Any sample transfer is a chance for tube switching
    - Wrong index used in PCR
- Contamination
    - At time of collection 
    - Sample transfer
    - Extraction
    - PCR

---

# Wet lab errors?

- Failed extraction
- Failed PCR
- Mis-pooled

---

# Wet lab biases

- Sample storage
- DNA extraction
    - Method matters
    - compare methods!
        - Lysis (bead beating!)
    - Be method aware when using data

# Wet lab errors?

- DNA storage? 



- ![storage](DNAstorage.png){width=30%}
- PCR
    - Primer efficiency
    - Inhibitors
    - Polymerase error

---

# Other errors

- PCR errors
    - 16s amplification
    - In flow cell
- Sequence errors
    - Miscalled base
    - Carry over signal
    - Signal from neighboring cluster
    - Carryover between runs

- **Sequence negative controls!**
